        A croissant is a flaky, buttery pastry that originated in France. Its
        name, which means "crescent" in French, reflects its crescent moon-like
        shape. The origins of the croissant are somewhat debated, but it is
        commonly associated with Vienna, Austria. The croissant's modern
        version, however, is attributed to the French.

        <br />
        Legend has it that the croissant was introduced to France in the 19th
        century by Austrian bakers, who brought with them a similar pastry known
        as kipferl. The French then adapted and refined the recipe, adding more
        butter to create the delicious, delicate layers that are characteristic
        of the croissant we know today.

        Croissants are made from laminated dough, a process that involves
        layering butter between layers of dough and folding it multiple times to
        create numerous thin layers. This results in a light, flaky texture when
        baked. Croissants can be enjoyed plain or filled with various
        ingredients such as chocolate, almond paste, or ham and cheese. They
        have become an iconic part of French patisserie and are widely popular
        around the world.
